In Postman, you can make both GET and POST requests easily. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to access both GET and POST requests in Postman:

### GET Request:

1. Open Postman.
2. Choose the "GET" method from the dropdown menu next to the URL field.
3. Enter the URL for your GET request. In your case, it might be `http://localhost:9001/tasklist`.
4. If your request requires query parameters, you can add them in the "Params" tab.
5. Click the "Send" button to execute the GET request.
6. The response will be displayed in the "Body" section of the response pane.

### POST Request:

1. Open Postman.
2. Choose the "POST" method from the dropdown menu next to the URL field.
3. Enter the URL for your POST request. In your case, it might be `http://localhost:9001/tasklist/new`.
4. Go to the "Body" tab.
5. Choose the "form-data" option if your server expects form data.
6. Add a key-value pair for your task. For example, key: `task`, value: `New Task`.
7. Click the "Send" button to execute the POST request.
8. The response will be displayed in the "Body" section of the response pane.

Make sure your server is running while you are testing these requests. If you encounter any issues, the error messages or response status in Postman should provide additional information.

Remember to replace `http://localhost:9001` with the appropriate URL and port where your server is running. If you've modified the port or host in your Python code, adjust the URL accordingly.

Additionally, if your server is hosted on a different machine or network, replace `localhost` with the correct IP address or domain name.
